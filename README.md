# Egg Portfolio

https://portfolio.eggworld.me

Disgusting. It's a site full of JavaScript. If you turn JavaScript off, nearly everything breaks. I'm not a designer (random bullshit go!), but I am a fan of pretty gradients and moving lines, so consider this a secondary site to my [main website](https://eggworld.me).

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev
```
